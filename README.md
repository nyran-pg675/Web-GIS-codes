# 🌦️Papua-New-Guinea-Rainfall-Viewer
This is a small project I am working on that enables non-coders to easily visualize and analyze monthly rainfall patterns across Papua New Guinea. The platform is designed to make climate data more accessible and understandable for users who may not have technical programming or GIS skills.

It integrates remote sensing datasets and climate archives such as the CHIRPS dataset and presents them through an interactive, map-based interface built using Google Earth Engine. The goal is to bridge the gap between data science and environmental decision-making by making Earth observation data simple, visual, and actionable.

I warmly welcome feedback and suggestions to improve this repository — whether it’s refining workflows, enhancing visualization, or improving accessibility.
